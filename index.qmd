In this blog, I'm recording all of my simple experiments with queueing theory. I
watched [a video about Disney's
FastPass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjZpBq1XBE&t=2334s) even though I
generally don't care about Disney parks at all, and the video got me interested
in thinking about queueing theory, specifically how to simulate queues and
understand the distribution of waiting times and factors that affect waiting
time.
